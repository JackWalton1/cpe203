this is where I will write about the functions that make me nervous:

1) I almost did not initially know where to put moveToNotFull because it had two
   entity objects, but I chose entity

2) I decided to put adjacent in Point, although could have remained in Functions

3) Will not move loadImages or load from Functions because they use Scanner.java's data the most,
   which is a pre-made class that uses data from an interface

4) I decided to keep parse* in Functions, because it doesn't use much of the input's data

5) I decided to keep create* in Functions, because it doesn't use much of the input's data

6) Will not move processImageLine, getImages or setAlpha from Functions because they use
   PApplet.java's and PImage.java's data the most, which are pre-made classes that uses data
   from an interface

7) Moved NearestEntity to WorldModel because WorldModel is the only class that uses this method.

8) Didn't move distance_squared because it is very general, did not seem valuable to refactor
